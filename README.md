#INTRODUCTION

This repository contains a minimalistic Appium Test Suite written in Java that runs a few simple tests on a Conde Nast android app. To run the tests successfully you'll need have the .apk file of the app which is placed in resources/apps. 

This can be used as a starting point for your own Test Suite.
